#9_8_23____left out columns
"My read function isn't reading all the columns in my .csv
    I think this is due to those collumns containing "" (or blannks)
    But, I don't know how to run the swapping code without the columns already loaded into R.
    When I run names(platte_fish), only the species without gaps are present. What am I doing wrong? :(
