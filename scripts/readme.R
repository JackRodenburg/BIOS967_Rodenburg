readme for platte_fish_cleaned.csv

This is Platte River fish data collected by Dr. Mark Pegg and his lab at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, from 2007-2017. Certain columns of the original csv. file "platte_fish" were trimmed to form the "platte_fish_cleaned" version. This includes the following variables, which I find relevant for my research questions.

Variables:
Year: The year the fish was collected
Month: The month the fish was collected
Day: The day the fish was collected
Species: The 3 digit species ID number, used in correspondence with a conversion table to understand which species have which
Count: How many of each species were found in the net

I also separated out fish (species or genus) of interest in separate variables:
sturgeon
pallid_sturgeon
catfish
carp

My research aims are to study how the 2012 drought effected fish populations in the Nebraskan Platte River. The fish populations are chosen to represent an endangered species (pallid sturgeon), a genus that is regularly restocked and harvested for recreation (catfish), and a particularly aggressive invasive genus (carp).
